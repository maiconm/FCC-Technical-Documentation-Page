            Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform
          </p>
          <strong>Optimized for UI</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop with a programming language specialized around the needs of user interface creation</li>
            <li>Mature and complete async-await for user interfaces containing event-driven code, paired with isolate-based concurrency</li>
            <li>A programming language optimized for building user interfaces with features such as the spread operator for expanding collections, and collection if for customizing UI for each platform</li>
            <li>A programming language that is easy to learn, with a familiar syntax</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Productive development</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Make changes iteratively: use hot reload to see the result instantly in your running app</li>
            <li>Make changes to your source code iteratively, using hot reload to instantly see the effect in the running app</li>
            <li>Write code using a flexible type system with rich static analysis and powerful, configurable tooling</li>
            <li>Do profiling, logging, and debugging with your code editor of choice</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Fast on all platforms</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Compile to ARM & x64 machine code for mobile, desktop, and backend. Or compile to JavaScript for the web</li>
            <li>AOT-compile apps to native machine code for instant startup</li>
            <li>Target the web with complete, mature, fast compilers for JavaScript</li>
            <li>Run backend code supporting your app, written using a single programming language</li>
          </ul>
